Build Dependencies:
=================================================================================================================================
The code is written in Java. Java 1.8 is required.

All components are built using Apache Maven, version 3.3.3 or newer.

The projects are located at https://github.com/connectedvehiclessitdat.

Several of the projects depend on the fedgov-cv-private-resources or fedgov-cv-private-resources-webapp projects.  These 
projects contain private information that is not to be made public, such as passwords, usernames, keystores, truststores, etc.
These projects are not publicly available and must be created locally for anyone wishing to build the code.  The
fedgov-cv-private-resources-sample and fedgov-cv-private-resources-webapp-sample are available to show how the projects
are formatted and provide the source code for the helper class in the private resource projects that is used to pull the private
resources from the JAR after it is compiled.

There are a few projects that depend on projects beginning with fedgov-cv-asn1-generated-*.  The ASN.1 Generated projects contain
code that was generated using OSS ASN.1 Studio and is not allowed to be distributed per the licensing with OSS.  For anyone wishing
to build the code, there must be similar projects containing all the classes as defined in the ASN.1 specifications, as well as a
class to encode/decode the PDUs from/to UPER.

Many of the projects depend on the Parent POM located in the fedgov-cv-parent project. This project must be available at the
same directory level as the other projects.


=================================================================================================================================
Build Steps:
=================================================================================================================================

The Parent POM project should be built first:

	fedgov-cv-parent

Several projects also depend on the private resources. These projects should be built next (Note: order doesn't matter here):

	fedgov-cv-private-resources
	fedgov-cv-private-resources-webapp
	fedgov-cv-private-resources-non-cas-webapp

Since most projects use ASN.1 generated code, the fedgov-cv-asn1-generated-* projects should be third to be built:

	fedgov-cv-asn1-generated-j2735
	fedgov-cv-asn1-generated-ieee1609dot2
	fedgov-cv-asn1-generated-scms

Since many of the projects depend on the common library, it is next to be built. The order in which the projects should be
built for the common library is:

	fedgov-cv-security
	fedgov-cv-security-de
	fedgov-asn1-generated-j2735
	fedgov-asn1
	fedgov-cv-common

Another dependency that is common among several projects is the use of websockets. It is recommended that the websocket related
projects are next to be built:

	fedgov-cv-websocket

At this point, the most common dependencies have been built and most of the remaining projects should be able to be compiled
without having to compile any other projects.

If there is ever any confusion on what is required to build a project, that can be determined by looking at the project's pom.xml
file.  This file will contain a list of dependencies that are required to build the project.  Any dependency that contains the
groupId of gov.usdot is a project that must be available and built prior to the current project being built.  Note that the
dependencies listed in the pom.xml is not the complete picture of what projects or what order projects must be built to build the
current project.  Rather the dependencies in the pom.xml are the immediate dependencies on which the current project relies. There
may be a dependency hierarchy on which some of the dependencies themselves rely on.  For example, the fedgov-cv-common project
depends on the fedgov-cv-asn1 project, and so, it is listed in the fedgov-cv-common's pom.xml.  However, the fedgov-cv-asn1 project
in turn depends on the fedgov-cv-asn1-generated-j2735 project.  The fedgov-cv-asn1-generated-j2735 dependency will not be explicitly
stated in the fedgov-cv-common's pom.xml.  Instead, to see that it is needed, the fedgov-cv-asn1's pom.xml must be viewed.  Therefore,
to determine the actual build order of a project, multiple pom.xml's may need to be viewed to figure out the dependency hierarchy.
